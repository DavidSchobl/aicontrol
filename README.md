# AI Controller for Windows: Streamlining Your AI Experience

Welcome to AI Controller for Windows (AICW) – where managing AI tools becomes not just easy, but intuitive. Say goodbye to the endless clicking through file managers to find that elusive batch file; AICW is here to streamline your AI management process, saving you time and keeping your sanity intact.

## Installation
To get started with AICW, follow these simple steps:
1. Download the latest version from the GitHub repository.
2. Extract the files to your preferred location.
3. Run `setup.bat` to create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.
4. Start AICW by executing `run.bat` or launch the compiled `.exe` to dive into a seamless AI management experience.

## The Birth of AICW
AICW came to life from the all-too-common frustrations like scouring through file managers for the right batch file and the absence of timestamps in AI console outputs (Stable Diffusion, we’ve got our eye on you). This tool is designed to make your life easier, consolidating your AI management into a single, efficient platform.

## Features
- **Simplified AI Management**: Easily add your application with its `.bat` file location, name, and unique port, streamlining the monitoring and control process.
- **Unified Log Viewing**: View logs from all your AI tools in one console, complete with the much-needed timestamps.
- **Status at a Glance**: The application button changes from yellow to green, visually indicating the readiness and operational status of your AI tools.
- **Instant UI Access**: A simple button click takes you directly to your AI tool’s web interface because efficiency matters.
- **Expand Your Arsenal**: Add as many AI tools as you like; AICW handles them all.
- **Persistent Settings**: Your configurations are safely stored in `settings.json`, ensuring your setup remains intact.
- **Language Flexibility**: With the `en.json` file in the `lng` folder, you can customize messages and translate the interface, making it universally accessible.

## Good to Know
- AICW is your AI command center, not the AI itself. Ensure each AI tool is installed with batch files ready, and remember, each application must have a unique port for proper communication functionality.
- Pro Tip: Pin the `run.bat` or `.exe` file to your start bar for swift access to your AI tools.

## What’s Next (TBD)
- Introducing more intuitive language settings – because life’s too short for manual file edits.
- Simplifying application edits – because we know your time is valuable.
- Implementing visible version numbers in the `.exe` file, keeping you informed and updated.
- Repairing minor errors.

## Known Quirks
- AICW diligently tries to close all AI processes on exit, but sudden app closures might leave some processes running. A quick Task Manager visit can fix that.
- We’re aware the UI won’t win any beauty contests yet, but we’re committed to making it sleeker and more user-friendly.
- While `.exe` creation with PyInstaller might obscure the console, opting for `run.bat` keeps it visible. Choose what works best for your workflow!

## Acknowledgments
Managing AI tools effectively requires a reliable and efficient system, and AICW has been crafted with this in mind, incorporating feedback and iterative improvements to enhance its functionality.
